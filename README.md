# My YiYi Config in NixOS

**A chill config for just plug and play.**
**No cordial greetings**

## About

This repository contains a basic configuration for NixOS using flakes and home-manager,
with focus on school and dev environment, but with things for
playing as well. Currently use [Hyprland](https://hypr.land/) as compositor and
[Noctalia(V4)](https://noctalia.dev/) as desktop shell.

### About the Structure

This project contains the basic `configuration.nix` in the root where is defined
some configurations for the environment packages, the compositor, the SDDM and
some default stuff.

In the `flake.nix` is the main part for import the rest of the modules, and the
output point for the templates.

> [!NOTE]
> The `hardware-configuration` is the default template that NixOS generates.

In the `assets` folder is the multimedia that was used for personalized a bit of
the desktop environment.

The `templates` folder is where live some templates for different things and focus
in some technologies, for example a basic [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/es/)
template for basic projects in the version 1.95.

Inside the `home` folder live the `home.nix` file that import the most of package
that is using in this configuration. Then, exists 2 main folder, one focuses in
dev-tools and other focuses in chill(The life is good).
